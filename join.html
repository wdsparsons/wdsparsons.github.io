						<h1>Getting Involved</h1>
						<p>We welcome all who are interested in giving AFF a go (whether you have experience playing American Football or not), with a free, 3-training session trial. However, as we are an Adult AFF club, participants must be 16 years of age or older and those under 18 years old must have a parent or legal guardian complete our athletic waiver of liability (which is included in the new player registration process).</p>
						<p>Over the course of your trial, you’ll participate in both skills drills and scrimmage games that will allow our team captains the opportunity to assess your performance at various Offensive and Defensive positions to determine where they feel you’d fit in best with our club should you want to continue with London Rebels when your trial ends.</p>

						<h1>WHAT EQUIPMENT IS REQUIRED FOR TRAINING</h1>
						<p>In the interest of player safety, you MUST have cleats/boots AND either pocketless OR zip pocket clothing (shorts, jumpers, etc.). Those without proper footwear or attire WILL NOT be allowed to train. NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>

						<p>If you need pocketless shorts, we recommend our official training shorts which can be purchased HERE.</p>
						<p>
						Equipment such as receiver gloves, knee or elbow pads, gum shields, etc., are recommended but completely optional.</p>
						<p>

						Flag belts and all other necessary equipment for training will be provided for you during your trial; just be sure to bring plenty of water with you!</p>

						<h1>READY TO START YOUR TRIAL?</h1>
						<p>Click the link below to launch our New Player Registration process which includes the following:</p>

						<p>1. Completing some basic information about yourself, your level of familiarity with American Football, and your general athletic background.</p>
						<p>2. Additional information about the club, including the different types of memberships available and their respective costs. (PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY)</p>
						<p>3. Player agreement and liability waiver (Required)</p>
						<p>4. Data Privacy Policy Acknowledgment (Required)</p>
						<p>Once you've submitted your new player registration, one of our team captains will invite you to join our community by providing you with a link to our WhatsApp group. You'll then be able to interact with other club members and, most importantly, vote in the training availability polls to let us know when you can start your trial. Who knows, you might be our next star player!</p>
